# dnn
Project devoted to deep neural networks.
Its written in Python using Theano (http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/ Theano uses NVidia CUDA cuDNN).

Current state of the project:
- Multilayer perceptron with back-propagation
- autoencoder 
- stacked autoencoders (each layer pretrained with autoencoder, after pretraining standard back-propagation)
- code to visualise results and make experiments
